        Cricket is a sport that is deeply embedded in the hearts of Indians.
        But, is the time and energy invested in watching and playing cricket
        truly justified? Let's See.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cricket maintains a stronghold in the Indian subcontinent. Here, the
        cricket players are revered to an almost divine status. It lacks
        popularity in more developed countries like United States, Canada, and
        European nations. These countries developed their own sporting culture
        rather than embracing the remnants of colonial influence.
      </p>

      <p>
        One must ask, what value does watching cricket add to one's life?
        Cricket matches are notoriously lengthy, extending from six hours to
        five days. This drains enormous commitment of time and energy for the
        viewer. Compare this to the sports like hockey or football, they offer
        thrilling matches that conclude within an hour or so. The disparity in
        value for time spent is evident.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recently(written on 12 Sept, 2023), An India-Pakistan match took place
        in the Asia Cup. That match was delayed by an entire day due to
        rainfall. This single match effectively consumed two days of the
        country's attention and energy, all in the name of a rivalry that has
        been perpetuated for far too long. Many such matches have happened in
        the past and surely will continue to happen in the future. But this Us
        vs. them mentality with Pakistan, when will this end?
      </p>

      <p>
        We are a country with over 1.4 billion population. Our inability to
        secure medals at the Olympics is disheartening. Our unwavering focus on
        cricket is hindering the growth of other sports. At the Olympics,
        Smaller nations consistently outshine us in terms of gold medal count.
      </p>

      <p>
        From a player's perspective - With only two players batting at a time
        and fielders maintaining static positions, the game lacks the constant
        movement and engagement found in other outdoor sports. This raises
        concerns about whether we are truly maximizing our physical potential by
        dedicating our time and energy to cricket.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cricket's dominance in India extends only to the men's team. The neglect
        of the women's team is disappointing. They lack the viewership,
        sponsorship pay, reputation, and influence enjoyed by their male
        counterparts.
      </p>

      <p>
        The elimination of cricket as the primary sport of the country is an
        essential step in the process of removing colonial marks. How can we
        rename monuments and roads named after colonizers while simultaneously
        embracing their sporting legacy?
      </p>

      <p>
        As a kid, I was always advised not to watch cricket by my elders. While
        the players' bank accounts swell, the watchers, who form the backbone of
        the sport, remain largely unchanged, their lives untouched by the
        glamour and wealth that surrounds the game they love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our nation's progress lies in diversifying our sporting interests and
        nurturing talent across various disciplines. It's time to break free
        from the chains of colonial ideologies, explore other avenues, and
        ensure that our investments of time and energy truly enrich our lives
        and contribute to our nation's success.
