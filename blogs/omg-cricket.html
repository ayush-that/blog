          Cricket is a sport that is deeply embedded in the hearts of Indians.
          But, is the time and energy invested in watching and playing cricket
          truly justified? Let's See.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cricket maintains a stronghold in the Indian subcontinent. Here, the
          cricket players are revered to an almost divine status. It lacks
          popularity in more developed countries like United States, Canada, and
          European nations. These countries developed their own sporting culture
          rather than embracing the remnants of colonial influence.
        </p>

        <p>
          One must ask, what value does watching cricket add to one's life?
          Cricket matches are notoriously lengthy, extending from six hours to
          five days. This drains enormous commitment of time and energy for the
          viewer. Compare this to the sports like hockey or football, they offer
          thrilling matches that conclude within an hour or so. The disparity in
          value for time spent is evident.
        </p>

        <p>
          Recently(written on 12 Sept, 2023), An India-Pakistan match took place
          in the Asia Cup. That match was delayed by an entire day due to
          rainfall. This single match effectively consumed two days of the
          country's attention and energy, all in the name of a rivalry that has
          been perpetuated for far too long. Many such matches have happened in
          the past and surely will continue to happen in the future. But this Us
          vs. them mentality with Pakistan, when will this end?
        </p>

        <p>
          We are a country with over 1.4 billion population. Our inability to
          secure medals at the Olympics is disheartening. Our unwavering focus
          on cricket is hindering the growth of other sports. At the Olympics,
          Smaller nations consistently outshine us in terms of gold medal count.
        </p>

        <p>
          From a player's perspective - With only two players batting at a time
          and fielders maintaining static positions, the game lacks the constant
          movement and engagement found in other outdoor sports. This raises
          concerns about whether we are truly maximizing our physical potential
          by dedicating our time and energy to cricket.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cricket's dominance in India extends only to the men's team. The
          neglect of the women's team is disappointing. They lack the
          viewership, sponsorship pay, reputation, and influence enjoyed by
          their male counterparts.
        </p>

        <p>
          The elimination of cricket as the primary sport of the country is an
          essential step in the process of removing colonial marks. How can we
          rename monuments and roads named after colonizers while simultaneously
          embracing their sporting legacy?
        </p>

        <p>
          As a kid, I was always advised not to watch cricket by my elders.
          While the players' bank accounts swell, the watchers, who form the
          backbone of the sport, remain largely unchanged, their lives untouched
          by the glamour and wealth that surrounds the game they love.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our nation's progress lies in diversifying our sporting interests and
          nurturing talent across various disciplines. It's time to break free
          from the chains of colonial ideologies, explore other avenues, and
          ensure that our investments of time and energy truly enrich our lives
          and contribute to our nation's success.
