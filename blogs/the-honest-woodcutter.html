        Once upon a time in a small village by the woods, there lived a
        woodcutter. He was hardworking with a simple daily routine. He wakes up
        in the afternoon, takes a shit and straight up goes to the nearby woods
        to chop trees. He had chopped over a million trees by now and was solely
        responsible for destroying the nearby forest to the verge of extinction.
        However, it was beneficial for the villagers. They do not have to pay a
        visit to the zoo to see wild animals now. All of this came at a small
        negligible cost of the animals sometimes eating the small children of
        the village.
      </p>

      <p>
        One fine afternoon, as usual, the poor woodcutter was on his way deep
        into the jungle on his tractor to find new trees to deforest. Suddenly,
        his gaze caught a big thicc tree that he had never seen before. It was
        beside a small pond and with a signboard saying screaming ‚ÄòDON‚ÄôT CUT‚Äô.
      </p>

      <p>
        The woodcutter ignored all the bullshit and started striking the thicc
        tree with his axe. Suddenly, his axe slipped from his hand straight into
        the pond. Alas! Moaned the woodcutter. But then to his surprise all of a
        sudden a fairy appeared from the lake with three axes in her hand - a
        gold axe, a silver axe, and a bronze axe.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‚ÄúOh dear, Which one is yours?‚Äù the lake fairy asked the honest
        woodcutter. The woodcutter had read the story before and thus he told
        the fairy ‚ÄúThe gold axe! That mine!‚Äù. The stupid fairy, following the
        old script, was impressed by his honesty and gave him all three axes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The honest woodcutter thought of taking advantage of this glitch he had
        found in the matrix. He brought another iron axe from his nearby tractor
        and threw it into the lake. But this time instead of a magic fairy‚Äôs
        apparition, he heard a loud thud which was followed by the pond turning
        red. Looks like the poor woodcutter‚Äôs axe had killed the fairy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Panic struck the woodcutter as he saw this murder had been witnessed by
        a passerby. In no time, the police arrived at the scene. After careful
        examination of the murder scene, the police arrested the honest
        woodcutter for cutting the tree despite the warning.
