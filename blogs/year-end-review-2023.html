        <p>
          First of all, I am not too fond of celebrating the new year. For a
          Virat Hindu (pun intended) like me, my new year is on the first day of
          Chaitra. But I do get invited to a New Year's Eve celebration every
          year and I take it gracefully.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I am a person with a very short memory retention power, it is
          quintessential to write down how my year went or else I will forget it
          just like I have forgotten the previous twenty or so.
        </p>

        <p>
          The process of foregtting has already begun and so this blog does not
          represent everything that has happened to me this year, it only has
          the things that I still remember.
        </p>

        <p>
          So here I go, writing about what I went through this year, the lessons
          I learned, the Ws I snatched, the Ls I took, the changes I saw in
          myself in these 365 days, and finally what I want my 2024 to be like!

            src="../Images/blog/ncc-nameplate.jpeg"

        </div>
        <p>
          The best experience I‚Äôve had this year was at NCC. I simply belong
          there. It provides me with a platform to meet some amazing people, fly
          planes, fire weapons, and serve the nation. Every time I step into
          that parade ground, I‚Äôm carrying a legacy with me.
        </p>

        <p>
          The freshest experience I had this year was college. It took me 20
          years to get there but honestly, it's worth it solely because of the
          freedom of self-improvement that I get there. After, three years of
          grinding, I can safely say it's worth it.
        </p>

        <p>
          My first solo trip to Kolkata and my second solo trip to Prayagraj
          were such a refreshing experience as well. I was so overwhelmed with
          joy the moment Sealdah Rajdhani took off from NDLS.

          Standing at this railway station, a thousand miles away from home with
          the task of finding food, shelter, and a companion for myself. I
          learned to survive alone and make friends impromptu.
        </p>

        <b id="the-goodies">The Goodies:</b>

        <p>
          I got a chance to visit Bihar after six years. That place is my
          motherland and every time I go there I come back motivated to do great
          in life so I don‚Äôt have to go back there.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started to grow an online presence. It will take a lot of time and
          effort but I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve finally started using the internet for a good
          cause. I got rid of my Reddit/ib use as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          I got my first phone gifted by my sister, my first TWS which I bought
          with my own money. It feels great buying books, snacks, accessories
          heck even a toffee when it's your money.
        </p>

        <p>
          Getting my first internship was a great thing that happened this year.
          It taught me why not to do internships and stick to freelancing.
        </p>

        <p>
          I got the chance to attend numerous events and all of them were
          amazing. Met new people, learned new things, and ate some amazing
          food. Also, I experienced a 5‚òÜ hotel.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started my liberation process; and created a personal site and a
          personal blog as well. I stuck to using free software and Linux.
        </p>

        <b id="my-failures">My Failures:</b>

        <p>
          I failed JEE for the 3rd and 4th time. This was when I had given my
          100% to the preparation. I‚Äôm just not made for meme exams I reckon.
        </p>

        <p>
          I failed to retain academic knowledge. It‚Äôs like I remember nothing
          after an exam is over and the next time I have to start from the
          basics.
        </p>

        <p>
          I missed all the opportunities to meet my old and true school friends.
          It‚Äôs been 1.5 years and I miss all of them a lot.
        </p>

        <p>
          I failed to make it past the screening stage in two SSB interviews.
          The second time had me in tears. With no more attempts left, I have
          plenty of time to prepare before facing anymore.

          I lost my greatest companion, my truest love, LMAO. I cried a lot when
          he left us. I hope wherever he is, he is happy and free. I miss him a
          lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          I‚Äôd say, the relation-building has been satisfying. From zero friends
          made last year to three this year, I‚Äôd say this is good progress. I
          made goal buddies and meaningful acquaintances as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even for family relationships, it has been better. I talked with my
          uncles and older elders. The only bad thing is that I don‚Äôt have the
          privilege of my sister‚Äôs in-person company anymore.

          The most noticeable change is my looks. I lost more weight and
          transformed from a hairy bear to a short-haired, clean-shaven human
          being. I‚Äôd like to keep this look.

          I care a lot less about what other people think about me now and that
          comes with being more bad-mouth with people.

        <b id="2024">2024?:</b>

        <p>
          I want to start investing. My money has been rotting in the bank for
          so long but no more. I will learn more about growing money and track
          my finances as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          I want to run a marathon and attend as many camps as I can (if I don‚Äôt
          get kicked from NCC lol). Also, I want to stop this anxiety-shivering.
        </p>

        <p>
          I want to buy a laptop, sticker bomb it with hundreds of stickers, and
          make a home server out of the Raspberry Pi 3.

          I believe that neither the journey nor the destination matters. The
          only thing that matters is the people with whom you were during that
          journey.
        </p>

        <p>
          I‚Äôm grateful to everyone who invested even a blink of their time in
          me. It means a lot.
